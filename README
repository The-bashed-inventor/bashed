Welcome to "bashed", the bash script debugger.

There is no install script, but installation is trivial.
1. Copy the tar file to /tmp/ on your machine.
   You probably already have a directory where you install stuff, e.g. $HOME/installed
   Create a new "bashed" subdirectory there:
   mkdir $HOME/installed/bashed

2. Expand the tar file into this directory with:
   cd $HOME/installed/bashed
   tar xvf /tmp/bashed.tar

3. Create a symbolic link to the "bashed" script from your favourite bin directory:
   cd $HOME/bin
   ln -s $HOME/installed/bashed/bashed bashed

4. There is an example script to debug in example.sh
   cd $HOME/install/bashed
   bashed example.sh

   You should see this:

   Bash debugger version 0.1.  Type 'h' or '?' for help.
   Debugging example.sh (with bash 3) and no args
